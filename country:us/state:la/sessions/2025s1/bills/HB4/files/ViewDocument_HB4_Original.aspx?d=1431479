Abstract: Provides for the 2026 fall primary election to serve as a primary election for
party primary offices and for the 2026 fall general election to serve as a general
election for party primary offices.
Present law effective January 1, 2026, provides that there shall be a fall primary election
held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November for officers elected at the same
time as members of congress in that year. Proposed law retains present law.
Present law provides that the fall primary election date shall also serve as the general

provides that the candidate who receives the most votes cast for a party primary office in the
general election is elected.

primary office candidate who receives a majority of the votes cast for the office in the
primary election is elected.
Present law effective January 1, 2026, provides that there shall be a fall general election held
on the sixth Saturday after the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of a
congressional election year and does not include party primary offices in the fall general

election date for a party primary office to be elected in 2026 and provides that a party
primary office candidate who receives the most votes cast for the office in the general
election is elected.
Effective upon signature of governor or lapse of time for gubernatorial action.
